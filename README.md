# ENS dApp

A modern web application that connects to Ethereum wallets and displays Ethereum Name Service (ENS) information.

## Overview

This dApp allows users to connect their Ethereum wallet (via various providers like MetaMask, WalletConnect, etc.) and displays their ENS name if they have one registered. The application is built with modern web technologies and provides a smooth, responsive user experience with dark/light mode support.

## Features

- **Address Truncation**: Shows truncated Ethereum addresses for readability
- **Responsive Design**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatically switches based on system preferences
- **Modern UI**: Beautiful gradient texts, animations, and transitions

## Technologies Used

- **Next.js 14**: React framework for server-side rendering and static site generation
- **RainbowKit**: UI components for wallet connections
- **Wagmi**: React hooks for Ethereum interaction
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for styling
- **Ethereum**: Integration with the Ethereum blockchain and ENS
- **Inter Font**: Modern, clean typography
